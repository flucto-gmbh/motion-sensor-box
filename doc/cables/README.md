### Cable lengths
Bulgins_out to cube + :  Cut one side of the Fuse to 65mm length. Leave the other one as is      
Bulgins_out to cube - :  265mm 1mm^2 

Bulgins_out to battery +:  270mm 1mm^2  
Bulgins_out to battery -:  240mm 1mm^2

### Manufacturing and Assembly Tips

- start with connecting the pairs of power cables (both +, both -) and then solder the connectors to these ends
- Bulgins soldering connectors have a small diameter hole - therefore, deinsulate a longer length on one of the wires. This may then go into the bulgins conenctor.
- hot air will help shaping the power cables a bit, so they will fall easier into their place later
- short rings of shrinking tube will help keeping the cables together while maintaining flexibility (cable sleeves would also do the trick)

## USB-GNSS cable
How it should look like in the end: Image 62_fullresolution

Use the following table for soldering the USB-cable to the GNSS-cable with the JST-style connector: 

|GNSS side   | A     | B     | C   | D     | E    |

|USB side    | white | green |*cut*| black | red  |

### GNSS Cable colours

#### Caution! Before startup, make sure the GNSS connector is correctly oriented in the gnss board, since there are two different styles of connectors (5 pin/6 pin)
