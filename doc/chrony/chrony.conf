# SHM0 from gpsd is the NEMA data at 4800bps, so is not very accurate
refclock SHM 0  delay 0.5 refid NEMA

# SHM1 from gpsd (if present) is from the kernel PPS_LDISC
# module.  It includes PPS and will be accurate to a few ns
# refclock SHM 1 offset 0.0 delay 0.1 refid NEMA+

# SOCK protocol also includes PPS data and 
# it also provides time within a few ns
refclock SOCK /var/run/chrony.ttySC0.sock delay 0.0 refid SOCK

# PPS is from the /dev/pps0 device.  Note that
# chronyd creates the /var/run/chrony.ttyS1.sock device, but
# gpsd creates the /dev/pps0 device
# openrc rules start gpsd /after/ chronyd, so /dev/pps0 
#   is not created until after chronyd is started
#   If you want to use pps0, either edit the openrc rules
#   or add this source after gpsd is started
