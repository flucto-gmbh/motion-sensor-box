# Sending and Receiving

## 0. Preface

There are a number of transport protocols available for sending and receiving data. Among these are:
- TCP: old, reliable, prone to failing connections. Easy to encrypt
- UDP: old, fast, reliable -> good for real time, fire and forget, not encrypted
- QUIC: based upon UDP, but with security comparable to SSL/TLS
- MQTT: 
- CoAP
- AMQP
- Websocket
- Node
