# ICM-20948

Notes for programminig the TDK InvenSense ICM-20948

## General

The ICM-20948 includes a linear accelerometer, a rotational accelerometer (often referred to as a gysroscope) and a magnetometer (e.g. compass). 
Internally, all sensors feature ADCs, where Gyroscope and Accelerometer ADCs have a width of 16 bits and the compass ADC has a width of 12 bits. 

Output data rate can be aligned, using the ODR_ALIGN_EN register on user bank 0. 

### Gyroscope

The gyroscope can be configured to run in one of the following modes. As the width of the onboard analog-digital-converter is fixed to 16 bits, the scaling factors to convert raw measurements are also listed. 

| GYRO_FS_SEL | Range   | Unit             | Scale factor  | Unit                          |
|-------------|---------|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| 0           | +- 250  | degree / seconds | 131           | Raw value / degrees / seconds |
| 1           | +- 500  | degree / seconds | 65.5          | Raw value / degrees / seconds |
| 2           | +- 1000 | degree / seconds | 32.8          | Raw value / degrees / seconds |
| 3           | +- 2000 | degree / seconds | 16.4          | Raw value / degrees / seconds |

The Gyroscope features a low pass filter with a response between 5.7 and 197 Hz. The output data rate depends on the mode the chip is operating under (low power, low noise).

### Acceleration

The acceleration sensor offers four ranges of sensibility as well

| ACCEL_FS    | Range   | Unit             | Scale factor  | Unit          |
|-------------|---------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0           | +- 2    | G (9,81 m / s^2  | 16384         | Raw value / G |
| 1           | +- 4    | G (9,81 m / s^2  |  8192         | Raw value / G |
| 2           | +- 8    | G (9,81 m / s^2  |  4096         | Raw value / G |
| 3           | +- 16   | G (9,81 m / s^2  |  2048         | Raw value / G |

The initial tolerance is guaranteed not to exceed +- 0.5 % and the dependence on temperature is no greater than +- 0.026 % / C. 
A low pass filter can be programmed with a range between 5.7 and 246 Hz Filter response. 
The output data range depends on the power mode (low noise, low power) and can be configured to be between 0.27 and 562.5 in low power mode and 4.5 to 4.5 kHz in low-noise mode. 

### Compass

The magnetometer offers a range of +- 4900 micro-Teslas, where the sensitivity scale factor is 20/3 raw measurement / micro-Tesla (0.15 micro-Tesla / LSB). The output data range is 100 Hz. 

### Temperature

Additionally, a temperature sensor is also availbale, which can be used to correct acceleration and / or other measurements. 

### Filters

For both accelerometer and gyroscope digital low pass filters are availbale. 
As a reminder, the following table lists the conversion between dB, power (P) and measured quantity, such as Voltage (F).

### Digital Motion Processor (DMP)



## Clocking

The Sensor includes two different internal clocks. If the CLKSEL register is set to 1, the sensor decides by itself which clock source should be used. Choosing the right clock source is paramount in order to guarantee a maximum accuracy of the DMP. See Chapter 4.14 in the Datasheet (p. 25) for more information. 

## FIFO and Interrupts

An internal FIFO with a size of 512 Bytes can hold a variety of different measurements, including processed data from the DMP. A FIFO counter keeps track of how many bytes of valid data are currently in the FIFO. The FIFO allows for burst reads. An interrupt can be used to trigger a read. On the WaveShare Sense Hat the interrupt pin is connected to WPi's pin 31 or BCM's GPIO pin 6 on the Raspberry Pi's header. Physically, it is pin 31. 
Furthermore, different Interrupts can be programmed on the ICM, including: wake on motion, DMP, Raw Data ready, FIFO Overflow and FIFO Watermark Interrupt. 

The following table lists the different, available interrupt sources:

| Interrupt Source |
|------------------|
| DMP Interrupt    |
| Wake on Motion   |
| PLL RDY          |
| I2C Master       |
| Raw Data Ready   |
| FIFO Overflow    |
| FIFO Watermark   |

## Interfaces

### I2C

The ICM always acts as a I2C slave device. The 7-bit address of the ICM 20948 is b110100X (7 bits!). To enable two ICM-20948 on the same bus, the last bit (X) can be modified by either pulling up AD0 to VCC/logic high (adress becomes b1101001) or pulling it to GND/logic low (address becomes b1101000). 

I2C is supported at standard speed (100 kHz) or high speed (400 kHz).
