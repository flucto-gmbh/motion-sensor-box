# msb_attitude
Sensor fusion to estimate the current attitude of motion sensor box

We are using [AHRS package](https://github.com/Mayitzin/ahrs/tree/87f9210cfcf6c545d86ae8588a93f012020164ee])

Quaternion are used to represent the orientation of the box relative to Earth coordinates (lat, lon, alt).

This Matlab site explains orientation, rotation and quaternions well: https://de.mathworks.com/help/fusion/ug/rotations-orientation-and-quaternions.html
